<!-- HPE Working -->
## HPE Working
- Human pose estimation (HPE) is the process of estimating the configuration of the body (pose) from a single, typically monocular, image. 
- It can be applied to many applications such as action/activity recognition, action detection, human tracking, in movies and animation, virtual reality, human-computer interaction, video surveillance, medical assistance, self-driving, sports motion analysis, etc.
- There are various methods through which HPE is done as shown below.

![HPE Catgories](https://github.com/anilbhatt1/Deep_Learning_EVA4_Phase2/blob/master/S5_Human_Pose_Estimation/Readme_Contents/HPE%20Method%20Categories.png)

- Here, we are implementing the HPE based on **Simple Baseline for HPE and tracking** paper. Paper can be referred here - https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06208.pdf
- Github reference for the same is https://github.com/microsoft/human-pose-estimation.pytorch/blob/master/README.md
- Openpose and Densepose are two other methods but these methods are complex compared to Simaple Baseline method that is followed here. **Simple Baseline for HPE and tracking** is aimed to ease the HPE problem. 
- This approach involves a few deconvolutional layers added on a backbone network, ResNet. This approach adds a few deconvolutional layers over the last convolution stage in the ResNet, called C5.
- By default, 3 Deconv layers with BN and ReLU as used. Each layer has 256 filters with 4x4 kernels. The stride is 2.
- A 1x1 convolutional layer is added at the last to generate predicted heatmaps for all k key points. MSE is used as the loss function.
- The targeted heatmap for joint k is generated by applying a 2D gaussian centered on the kth joint's ground truth location.
- 3D Keypoints are as shown in the skeleton below.

- Architecture is as below.
