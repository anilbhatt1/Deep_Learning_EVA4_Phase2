<!-- GAN Working -->
## GAN Working
- Whole idea of GAN is running around 2 deep neural networks - Generator (G) and Discriminator(D)
- Given a random set of latent vectors, Generator(G) will generate images.
- Discriminator (D) will identify whether this image is real or fake. 
- D will be fed with both real and fake images. D loss function will backpropagate based on D's prediction (Real - 1, Fake - 0)
- For each epoch, D will be trained first and G trained next.
- For G also training is done via D. G will generate fake image again and D will predict (Real - 1, Fake - 0). Loss will backpropagate again but this time for G. 
- Below image will help understand the flow Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

 ![DCGAN Flow](https://github.com/anilbhatt1/Deep_Learning_EVA4_Phase2/blob/master/S6_GAN/Readme_Contents/DCGAN%20Flow%20diagram.jpg)
- Below is an example of DCGAN with MNIST

- This work is dealing with generation of Indian cars using DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GANs)

<!-- Data Preparation -->
## Data Preparation
- 505 images of Indian cars were selected from web.
- All cars selected were front facing as shown below with most of the images with white or no background.
- This selection was done to make the network train with limited resource available via google colab.
- File creation colab link is as below
 https://github.com/anilbhatt1/Deep_Learning_EVA4_Phase2/blob/master/S6_GAN/EVA4_P2_S6_File_Creation.ipynb
- Enitre input dataset that was used for zip file creation can be found in below drive location
 https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SMv5kS5ZrMBbwTO35272Xyw3oB8oCMlE?usp=sharing
- Input image samples

<!-- DNN Architecture -->
## DCGAN DNN Architecture
- Two methods were followed as given below.
- First one adopted on Pytorch tutorial https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html
- Second one adopted based on https://github.com/Yangyangii/GAN-Tutorial/blob/master/CARS/DCGAN.ipynb
- Architecture followed was same in both methods. Difference lies in creating labels while training.
- Refer for receptive field & output size calculations used in architecture - both convolutions and transpose convolutions were used https://github.com/anilbhatt1/Deep_Learning_EVA4_Phase2/blob/master/S6_GAN/RF%20Calculator_S6_Modelled%20From_Cars_Mine.xlsx
- Network architecture for Generator is as follows:

![Generator Architecture](https://github.com/anilbhatt1/Deep_Learning_EVA4_Phase2/blob/master/S6_GAN/Readme_Contents/Generator%20Network.jpg)

- Network architecture for Discriminator is as follows:
